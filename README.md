# HungarianSolver

Fully responsive web application to solve assignment problems using Munkres assignment algorithm.

## Deployed:

Visit the app at [HungarianSolver](https://hungarian-solver.vercel.app/)

## Features

HungarianSolver offers the following features:

- Client-Side Architecture: The application runs entirely on the client-side, meaning no server is required to use it. This makes it easy to deploy and use in a wide range of environments.
- O(nÂ³) Implementation of the Munkres Algorithm: HungarianSolver uses a fast implementation of the Munkres algorithm (also known as the Hungarian algorithm or the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm) to quickly solve assignment problems.
- Fully Responsive: The application is designed to work seamlessly across a range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Switch between light and dark mode to optimize the application's appearance for different lighting conditions.
